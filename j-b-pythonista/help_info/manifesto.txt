J*b Tracker

A cross-platform job application tracker that begins as a Python CLI/Web prototype and eventually grows into a C++ application.

This project is designed to replace an Excel-based job tracker with a structured, database-backed system that lets you:

- Add and update applications
- Track application history
- Compute derived values like time since posting or pay conversions
- Export data
- Build toward a real GUI or web interface

Python is used for the prototype because it allows rapid development, easy database integration, and painless migration to web frameworks like Flask or FastAPI. C++ will be targeted later for performance and native GUI work.

The Python version includes:

- A Text User Interface (TUI) for interactive use
- SQL database (SQLite) for persistence
- Business logic for calculations
- Future optional Web GUI
