# J*b Tracker

Using the Google Style guide, I want to make proper C++ app to manage all my job application. I have a working draft in python I will also include in this project, and I pray they are of use to one another.

[Here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) is the style guide for reference.
