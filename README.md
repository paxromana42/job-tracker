# J*b Tracker

Using the Google Style guide, I want to make proper C++ app to manage all my job application. I have a working draft in python I will also include in this project, and I pray they are of use to one another.

[Here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) is the style guide for reference.

The Structure is something like this:
- python old
  - Python app that is basically a web gui that tracks the jobs. What this project should have stayed as, but I got curious on how to make the app from scratch.
- webgpu test
  - Testing making a working gui in webgpu, just because I hate myself.
- j*b-tracker
  - Final app marrying what I will learn from both of these modules.
